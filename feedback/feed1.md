Alright — judging **only your HOME PAGE**, strictly as a recruiter / hiring-manager who spends **20–40 seconds max** before deciding whether to continue.

I’ll be blunt and precise.

---

## 🧠 Recruiter Snapshot Verdict (Homepage Only)

**Visual polish:** ✅ Good
**Clarity of role:** ⚠️ Mixed
**System design signal:** ❌ Weak
**Backend identity:** ❌ Diluted
**Net effect:** *Looks busy and skilled, but not clearly hire-ready for backend/system roles*

Right now, your **GitHub README is stronger than your homepage**.
That is a problem — the homepage should be your **strongest filter**, not the weakest.

---

## 1️⃣ Hero Section (Most Important) — ❌ UNDERPERFORMING

### What the recruiter sees first:

> “A Software Engineer — Building scalable solutions”

This is **generic**.
Thousands of junior portfolios say this.

### Why this hurts you

From your README, you are:

* backend-focused
* system design oriented
* ownership-driven

From your homepage, you look like:

* a general full-stack / MERN dev
* tool-heavy
* surface-level

❌ **System design identity is invisible here.**

### What a recruiter thinks

> “Okay… but *what kind* of software engineer?”

That question must be answered **immediately**.

---

## 2️⃣ About Me Section — ❌ ACTIVELY DILUTING YOUR PROFILE

This paragraph is your biggest issue:

> “specializing in MERN Stack development with experience in Docker, Kubernetes, and Django…”

### Why this is bad (harsh truth)

* “MERN Stack developer” = **junior / frontend-leaning signal**
* Docker + Kubernetes mentioned with **no context** = resume padding signal
* No mention of:

  * system ownership
  * architecture
  * constraints
  * real users

This **directly contradicts** your carefully built system-engineer narrative.

🚨 If I were hiring backend engineers, this paragraph would lower your priority.

---

## 3️⃣ Experience & Education — ⚠️ OK BUT WEAKLY FRAMED

### What works

* MSc at DU → good academic signal
* Senior CS Instructor → credibility

### What’s missing

You list:

> “3+ years as senior cs instructor and practicing full-stack developer”

But you **don’t say what systems you owned**.

Recruiter question left unanswered:

> “Practicing *how*? On *what*?”

---

## 4️⃣ Skills Section — ❌ TOO MUCH, TOO NOISY

This is a **major red flag** for senior-leaning roles.

### Problems:

* Skill ratings (3.5/5, 4/5) → ❌ **Never do this**
* Too many categories:

  * AI/ML
  * Backend
  * Frontend
  * Graphics
  * Office tools (!)

This screams:

> “Jack of everything, master of nothing”

For backend/system roles:

* Photoshop
* Canva
* Office tools

👉 **actively hurt your signal**.

Recruiters don’t think:

> “Wow, versatile!”

They think:

> “Unfocused.”

---

## 5️⃣ Projects Section — ⚠️ VISUALLY GOOD, ENGINEERING-WEAK

### What works

* Clean cards
* Live demos + code links
* Real projects (good)

### What’s missing

Projects show:

* features
* tech stack

They do NOT show:

* architectural decisions
* system constraints
* why this project matters

Your strongest projects (CLI tools, pip packages, backend utilities) are framed like **product demos**, not **engineering case studies**.

---

## 6️⃣ Metrics Section — ⚠️ MIXED SIGNAL

This line is dangerous:

> “Programming Languages — 23+”

🚨 Recruiter reaction:

> “No one *masters* 23 languages.”

It weakens credibility.

The **1,000+ students mentored** metric is strong — keep that.

---

## 7️⃣ Footer Bio — ❌ CONTRADICTION AGAIN

Footer says:

> “Specialized in MERN and Django stacks with a strong focus on AI automation, cybersecurity, and system design.”

This is **too many identities**.

Pick ONE primary identity:

> Backend Engineer with system design ownership

Everything else supports that — not competes with it.

---

## 🔥 Overall Homepage Diagnosis

### What your homepage currently signals:

* Skilled
* Busy
* Generalist
* Instructor-first
* Tool-heavy

### What you WANT it to signal:

* Backend-first
* System design ownership
* Real systems
* Operational thinking
* Engineer who teaches (secondary)

Right now, there is a **gap**.

---

## 🎯 High-Impact Fixes (NO redesign, NO new projects)

### 1️⃣ Rewrite Hero Section (CRITICAL)

Replace:

> “A Software Engineer — Building scalable solutions”

With something like:

> **Backend Engineer · System Design Ownership**
> Designing and operating production systems under real constraints

This alone increases interview probability.

---

### 2️⃣ Kill “MERN Stack” from About Me

Replace with:

* backend systems
* architecture ownership
* real users
* operational responsibility

Never lead with MERN if you want backend/system roles.

---

### 3️⃣ Remove Skill Ratings & Non-Engineering Skills

Delete:

* Photoshop
* Canva
* Office tools
* Skill bars

Recruiters do not trust self-ratings.

---

### 4️⃣ Reframe Projects as “Systems”

Add **1 short line** under each project:

* Core constraint
* Key design decision

Example:

> “Designed as an offline-first system to reduce trust boundaries.”

That’s it. Huge upgrade.

---

### 5️⃣ Align Footer Bio with README

Use the SAME identity language everywhere.

Consistency = senior signal.

---

## 🧠 Final Recruiter Judgment (Homepage)

**Would I click Projects?** Maybe
**Would I trust system design claims?** Not yet
**Does this homepage match your real level?** ❌ No — it undersells you

Your homepage is **good for junior/full-stack roles**,
but **actively holds you back** for backend/system roles.

---

### The good news?

This is a **content problem, not a capability problem**.

If you want next, I can:

* Rewrite your **hero + about section** word-for-word
* Mark **exact lines to delete**
* Or help you align homepage, README, and resume into one narrative

Say the word.

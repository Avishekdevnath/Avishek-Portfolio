# Production Environment Setup

## Required Environment Variables

To fix the production errors, you need to set the following environment variables in your Vercel deployment:

### 1. Site Configuration
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://avishekdevnath.vercel.app
```

### 2. Database Configuration
```
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
```

### 3. Email Configuration (if using contact forms)
```
GMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
```

### 4. Cloudinary Configuration (if using image uploads)
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
```

## How to Set Environment Variables in Vercel

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project (avishekdevnath)
3. Go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
4. Add each variable with the appropriate value
5. Redeploy your application

## Critical Fix Applied

The main issue was in `src/app/projects/[id]/page.tsx` where:
- The code was trying to fetch from `localhost:3000` in production
- Changed to use relative URLs (`/api/projects/${id}`) which work in both dev and production
- Changed cache strategy from `no-store` to `force-cache` to enable static generation
- Improved `generateStaticParams` to properly generate static pages

After setting the environment variables and redeploying, the errors should be resolved.

# Current Error Status - Partially Resolved

## ✅ **Progress Made:**

### **Blog API Routes - FIXED**
- ✅ All blog API routes now use correct `connectDB()` function
- ✅ BlogStats model integration completed
- ✅ Production build shows all blog routes compiling successfully
- ✅ No more "Cannot find module for page: /api/blogs/[slug]/like" errors

### **Projects & Settings Routes - FIXED**
- ✅ Fixed `/api/projects/route.ts`
- ✅ Fixed `/api/projects/bulk/route.ts`
- ✅ Fixed `/api/projects/reorder/route.ts`
- ✅ Fixed `/api/settings/route.ts`
- ✅ Fixed `/api/experience/route.ts`
- ✅ Fixed `/api/experience/work/route.ts`
- ✅ Fixed `/api/experience/work/[id]/route.ts`

## 🔍 **Current Issues:**

### **1. Webpack Cache Corruption**
**Error**: `Cannot find module './3955.js'`
**Cause**: Corrupted webpack vendor chunks
**Impact**: Development server issues, but production build works

### **2. Remaining Routes with Database Issues**
**Still Need Fixing**:
- `src/app/api/experience/education/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/experience/education/[id]/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/seed-education/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/test/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/stats/route.ts.new`

## 📊 **Current Status:**

### ✅ **Working:**
- Blog API routes (all 7 routes)
- Projects API routes (main, bulk, reorder)
- Settings API route
- Experience API routes (main, work)

### ⚠️ **Partially Working:**
- Development server (webpack cache issues)
- Some experience education routes

### ❌ **Still Broken:**
- Webpack vendor chunks (development only)
- A few remaining API routes with database connection issues

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

1. **Fix remaining API routes** with database connection issues
2. **Clear webpack cache** to resolve development server issues
3. **Test production build** (should already be working)

## 🚀 **Good News:**

**The main build errors are resolved!** The production build completed successfully with all 64 pages generated. The remaining issues are primarily development server cache problems, not critical build failures.

**Blog functionality should now work correctly!** 🎉
